## Welcome to my Capstone project for my Per Scholas Software Development training program üéä

### In order to showcase all of the skills I've aquired on this 16 week learning journey, I have developed a full stack web app game for kids called ***Fantastical Pets***. It allows users to choose 2 creatures and morph them into one cute critter. They can decide if they want to give their new pet a name and / or description or have AI do it for them. They can also add it to their collection see a gallery of all the pets they've created.

### Objectives of the Capstone:
Create a practical MERN stack application that, solves problem, makes your life easier or does something cool

### Requirements:
- Full CRUD capabilities - at least these 4 routes ‚úÖ
- Schema ‚úÖ
- Index ‚úÖ
- Connected to your DB ‚úÖ
- 25 commits total +/- 3 ‚úÖ
- Well documented README
    - List of technologies used ‚úÖ
    - Acknowledgements for any resources ‚úÖ
    - Description of you Application ‚úÖ
    - Use MarkDown Language ‚úÖ
    - Link to other REPO ‚úÖ

### Tools I used:
- node.js
- nodemon
- express
- mongodb
- mongoose
- dotenv
- cors
- bcryptjs
- jsonwebtoken
- morgan

### Acknowledgements
- Gemini Flash 2.0 API for generating names and descriptions
    - https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/text-generation

- DeepAI API for generating images
    - https://deepai.org/docs#ai-image-generator

- My classmate Durga Pushadapu who brilliantly suggested I save animal1 and animal2 with the imageURL to my db so I can recall the hybrid pets already created and dramatically reduce the number API calls to DeepAI

- My instructor Dylan, @comeaudc, who walked us through developing a fullstack app from scratch including employing JWT and bcrypt as well as deployment. I refered to this repo A LOT
    - GameShop [Repository Name](https://github.com/comeaudc/TheGamesShopBE)

- StackOverFlow, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot (formerly Bing, not the Copilot that spoon feeds you code because that's plagiarism) for helping debug the 1 million errors I made
